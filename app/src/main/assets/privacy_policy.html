<h1><a id="Camera2Test_Privacy_Policy_0"></a>Camera2Test Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Camera2Test is an open source application with a purpose of providing you with the detailed information about cameras on your device.<br>
In order to provide this information, Camera2Test needs your permission to access cameras.<br>
Although this permission allows taking pictures and recording video, Camera2Test application is not doing that. This permission is only used for obtaining camera parameters (like sensor physical size, orientation and others).<br>
The obtained camera parameters data are not sent anywhere and are only shown to you on your device.<br>
No other user or device data is collected, other than the data that may be collected by the third-party services (see below).</p>
<h1><a id="Thirdparty_libraries_and_service_providers_6"></a>Third-party libraries and service providers</h1>
<p>Camera2Test application uses a number of third-party libraries which may have their respective Privacy Policies. The list of the third-party libraries is available in the build.gradle file available at FILE_LOCATION.<br>
The third-party libraries may collect some user and/or device information in order to provide their services.<br>
For example, Camera2Test application uses the Crashlytics SDK for obtaining various statistics about how application is used. Specifically, if the app crashes, Crashlytics collects the crash information (device model, crash stacktrace, etc.) and makes it available to the developers of Camera2Test over the Internet. This helps with troubleshooting of crashes and, consequently, addressing the reasons of crashes and making application more stable. Crashlytics also collects some device-specific information during the normal usage of the app (like the version of the app, device model, etc.).<br>
Please refer to the Privacy Policies of the respective third-party libraries for the detailed information.</p>
